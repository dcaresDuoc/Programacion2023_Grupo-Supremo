/* The goal of Clean Architecture is to keep the domain independent of the infrastructure. This means that the domain should not be affected by changes to the infrastructure and should not know anything about the infrastructure. Instead, the infrastructure should depend on the domain, and the domain should define its own interfaces and abstractions for the infrastructure to implement. */
